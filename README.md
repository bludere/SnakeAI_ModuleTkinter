## üóíÔ∏è Overview

A practical Deep Q-Learning agent trained to play Snake on a custom Tkinter grid.  
Built to test the exact match between state representation, action logic, and reward shaping.  
Model architecture adapted from Patrick Loeber‚Äôs open-source Snake AI for clarity and reproducibility.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- **Tkinter Environment** ‚Äî full game loop, grid rendering, and directional bindings in pure Tkinter.
- **Detailed State Vector** ‚Äî 13 inputs: relative danger, absolute heading, absolute food position, normalized distances.
- **3-Layer Feedforward Model** ‚Äî input ‚Üí two hidden layers with ReLU ‚Üí output: [straight, right, left].
- **Shaped Rewards** ‚Äî heavier penalty for self-collisions, step penalty to avoid stalling, bonus for closing distance to the apple.
- **Replay Buffer** ‚Äî deque with capacity up to 100,000 steps to stabilize learning.

## üìä How It Works

Standard DQN loop:
- `state_fetcher()` aligns relative direction logic with the snake‚Äôs turn actions.
- `_move()` adjusts `dx` and `dy` precisely, matching relative danger checks.
- `QTrainer` updates Q-values using the Bellman equation.
- `epsilon` decays to maintain exploration in early games.
