## 🗒️ Overview

A practical Deep Q-Learning agent trained to play Snake on a custom Tkinter grid.  
Built to test the exact match between state representation, action logic, and reward shaping.  
Model architecture adapted from Patrick Loeber’s Snake AI
[![patrickloeber/snake-ai-pytorch](https://img.shields.io/badge/Source-patrickloeber%2Fsnake--ai--pytorch-blue?logo=github)](https://github.com/patrickloeber/snake-ai-pytorch/blob/main/game.py).

## ⚙️ Features

- **Tkinter Environment** — full game loop, grid rendering, play_step func. and directional bindings in pure Tkinter.
- **Detailed State Vector** — 11 inputs: relative danger, absolute heading, absolute food position.
- **3-Layer Feedforward Model** — input → hidden layer with ReLU → output: [straight, right, left].
- **Shaped Rewards** — heavier penalty for self-collisions, step penalty to avoid stalling, bonus for closing distance to the apple.

## 📊 How It Works

Standard DQN loop:
- `state_fetcher()` aligns relative direction logic with the snake’s turn actions.
- `_move()` adjusts `dx` and `dy` precisely, matching relative danger checks.
- `QTrainer` updates Q-values using the Bellman equation.
- `epsilon` decays to maintain exploration in early games.
